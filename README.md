`copier-uv-packagee` is a [Copier](https://copier.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) template ideated to speed up the development process of Python applications. No more configuration hassle and boilerplate!

## ‚ö° Features

`copier-uv-application` offers a production-ready development environment, with many useful features like formatting, linting, pre-commit hooks, and documentation already set up. Here's an overview of the features:

- [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) is a comprehensive project and package management solution for Python.
- [`just`](https://github.com/casey/just/) is a modern rewrite of `make` in Rust ü¶Ä
- [`pre-commit`](https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit) validates your commits.
- [`ruff`](https://github.com/charliermarsh/ruff) provides static code analysis and a code and import formatting using [`black`](https://github.com/psf/black) and [`isort`](https://github.com/PyCQA/isort) styles.
- [`mypy`](https://github.com/python/mypy/) validates your type hints.
- [`pytest`](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest) runs your test suite.
- [`mkdocs`](https://github.com/mkdocs/mkdocs) builds your documentation, while [`mkdocs-material`](https://github.com/squidfunk/mkdocs-material) provides an elegant theme. [`mike`](https://github.com/jimporter/mike) takes care of versioning your docs.
- [`commitizen`](https://github.com/commitizen-tools/commitizen) ensures you follow [Conventional commit style](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/) and generates your release changelogs according to [SemVer](https://semver.org/)

> **Note**
>
> **Developer guidelines**
>
> - The template adopts to the `src` layout.
> - `mypy` is configured with a strict ruleset. The recommended approach to loosen those constraints is by temporary per-module ignores.
> - `numpy` is the docstring style of choice.
> - `ruff` is used to format the code using `black` style, while imports are sorted with `isort` style.
> - Releases follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).
> - Commit follow the [Conventional Commit](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) specification.

> **Note**
>
> **`just` a command runner**
>
> `just` recipes will save you a ton of time! Install [just](https://github.com/casey/just/tree/master#installation). To see the available recipes, run the following:
>
> ```bash
> just
> ```

## üõ†Ô∏è How to

Install [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) and [`just`](https://github.com/casey/just#installation):

```bash
# For Linux/ Mac Users
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

# for example, on macOS
brew install just
```

### Create a New Project

If you want to create a new package, or any coding project, you just have to run two short commands.

1. Initialise the template:

```bash
copier copy --trust gh:chaytus/copier-uv-application my-project
```


2. Initialize GitHub repository locally (necessary to install pre-commit hooks) and install all default dependencies, running the following `just` recipe:

```bash
just init
```

For this command to execute successfully, you need to have [`uc`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) and the [Git](https://git-scm.com/) installed.

If you do not want to configure CI/CD on GitHub, you can simply run the following:

```
just install
```

## üôã FAQ

### How do I write conventional commits?

Conventional commits are enforced with [`commitizen`](https://commitizen-tools.github.io/commitizen/), which is configured as a `pre-commit` hook at pre-push time. **In other words, if you attempt to push to a remote repo and your commit messages do not follow the conventional commits, the push will be rejected**. However, `commitizen` also offers a git command to commit with the conventional commit specification with a terminal UI. With `just`, you can simply run the following:

```bash
just commit
```

Or even the shorter `just c`. A prompt will guide you through the commit.

## üìù Template fields

```
- `project_name`: the name of the project indicated in `pyproject.toml`.
- `project_description`: the description of the project indicated in `pyproject.toml`.
- `author_fullname`: the author full name.
- `author_email`: the author email address.
- `author_organization`: the author organization.
- `repository_provider`: the repository provider (e.g., *GitHub*, *GitLab*, *BitBucket*). Only GitHub is supported for now.
- `repository_namespace`: the repository namespace.
- `package_name`: the package name.
- `copyright_license`: the selected license.
- `ensure_python_version`: the minimal python version required for the project.
- `python_package_distribution_name`: the Python package distribution name (for `pip install NAME`).
- `python_package_import_name`: the Python package import name (for `import NAME` in Python code)

## ü§ó Contributing

PR and issues are always accepted, especially since this project is far from being mature.

### Development

1. Install `uv` and `just`.

2. Clone the repository:

```bash
# using github cli
gh repo clone chaytus/copier-uv-application

# using git (SSH recommended)
git clone git@github.com:chaytus/copier-uv-application
```

3. Install the dependencies:

```
just install
```

### Before submitting a PR

Run the following:

```
just pre-release
```

The following operations will be performed:

1. Format with `ruff`.
2. Lint with `ruff`.
3. Run type checks with `mypy`.
4. Audit dependencies with `pip-audit`.
5. Check commit messages are consistent with Conventional Commits using `commitizen`.
6. Check whether a version bump is possible.
7. Run all tests.

This template is heavily inspired by [@montanarograziano](https://github.com/montanarograziano/), [@baggiponte](https://github.com/baggiponte) [Chef](https://github.com/baggiponte/chef/tree/main) (based on Cookiecutter) and [@pawamoy](https://github.com/pawamoy) [copier-uv](https://github.com/pawamoy/copier-uv) (based on Copier). They use respectively `pdm` and `uv` as packaging solution. Both are very well done and works great, and so...
